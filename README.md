# Description
An osu! Bongo Cat overlay with smooth paw movement and simple skinning ability, written in C++.

You can find how to configure the application in our [wiki](https://github.com/kuroni/bongocat-osu/wiki/Settings).

Download the program [here](https://github.com/kuroni/bongocat-osu/releases).

Hugs and kisses to [CSaratakij](https://github.com/CSaratakij) for creating the Linux port for this project!

Any suggestion and/or collaboration, especially that relating to sprites, is welcomed! Thank you!

## For developers
This project uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) and [JsonCpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp). JsonCpp libraries are directly included in the source using the provided `amalgamation.py` from the developers.

### Libraries and dependency

#### Windows and MinGW
To build the source, download the SFML libraries [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php), copy `Makefile.windows` to `Makefile`, then replace `tmp/SFML` in `Makefile` with the correct SFML folder.

#### Linux to Windows cross-compile
You need mingw with its binutils. You can check with your package manager for the exact name of these dependencies on your distro:
- mingw-w64-gcc
- mingw-w64-binutils

You also need to download the SFML libraries [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php), copy `Makefile.linux-to-windows_cross_compile` to `Makefile`, then replace `/tmp/SFML` in `Makefile` with the correct SFML folder.

#### Linux
You need to have these dependencies installed. Check with your package manager for the exact name of these dependencies on your distro:
- g++
- libxdo
- sdl2
- sfml
- x11
- xrandr

Then, copy `Makefile.linux` to `Makefile`.

### Building and testing
To build, run this command from the base directory:

```sh
make
```

To test the program, run this from the base directory:

```sh
make test
```

Alternatively, you can copy the newly-compiled `bin/bongo.exe` or `bin/bongo` into the base directory and execute it.

If you have troubles compiling, it can be due to version mismatch between your compiler and SFML. See [#43](https://github.com/kuroni/bongocat-osu/issues/43) for more information.
